# cayce-plugin-apex
This package contains rules for the cayce static analysis tool that pertain to the Apex programming language. The rules have been gathered from a small group of sources (personal experience and PMD's existing ruleset for starters.)

Please see the cayce-core repository, or take a look at the GitHub org [CayceCodes](https://github.com/caycecodes).
